Overview:
This project aims to predict employee attrition using machine learning models. Employee attrition, the phenomenon of employees leaving an organization voluntarily or involuntarily, can have significant impacts on business operations and productivity. By predicting attrition, organizations can take proactive measures to retain valuable employees and mitigate turnover risks.
Dataset:
The dataset used in this project contains various attributes of employees such as age, job role, department, education level, etc., along with a binary target variable indicating whether the employee has left the company (attrition) or not. It is sourced from the Human Resources department and serves as the basis for training and testing the predictive models.
Requirements:
Python 3
pandas
scikit-learn
Google colab or jupyter notebook
Setup and Usage:
1.Clone the repository:
git clone <repository_url>
cd employee-attrition-prediction
2.Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3.Run the code:
python main.py
View results:
The code will train multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Decision Tree Regression) using the dataset and evaluate their performance using various metrics. Results will be displayed in the console output.
